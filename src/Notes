Variables: What Are Variables?
        Ways to create variables?
        i)  dataType variableName = value; // When you know the exact  value you want to store

        ii) dataType variableName;   //When you don't know the exact value to store at that point
            variableName = value;

        a) 10
        dataType x = 10;

        Data Types:
        Primitive Data Types
         [We know in advance how much memory it will consume]
         [We don't need any object in order to use them]
            byte
            short
            int
            long
            float
            double
            char
            boolean

        Non-Primitive Data Types
         [We don't know in advance how much memory it will consume]
         [We need any object in order to use them]
            String
            Class
            Objects...

            ==============================================================
            Data Types:
             number (int[byte, short, int, long], decimal[float, double], single Character[char])
             boolean(true, false

             How much memory this will consume
             Whats the range of this data type

             byte - {1 Byte} or 8 bits: Range {-128 to 127}
             short- {2 Byte} or 16 bits
             int  - {4 byte} or 32 bits
             long - {8 byte} or 64 bits


             Note: How choose data type:
             i)	See the range in which the value fits
             a)	Only in the range of one data type  Use that data type
             b)	If it fits in range of multiple data types  Select the one which consumes the least memory


             byte b=10;
             b= b*20;
             system.out.println(b);
