Variables: What Are Variables?
        Ways to create variables?
        i)  dataType variableName = value; // When you know the exact  value you want to store

        ii) dataType variableName;   //When you don't know the exact value to store at that point
            variableName = value;

        a) 10
        dataType x = 10;

        Data Types:
        Primitive Data Types
         [We know in advance how much memory it will consume]
         [We don't need any object in order to use them]
            byte
            short
            int
            long
            float
            double
            char
            boolean

        Non-Primitive Data Types
         [We don't know in advance how much memory it will consume]
         [We need any object in order to use them]
            String
            Class
            Objects...

            ==============================================================
            Data Types:
             number (int[byte, short, int, long], decimal[float, double], single Character[char])
             boolean(true, false

             How much memory this will consume
             Whats the range of this data type

             byte - {1 Byte} or 8 bits: Range {-128 to 127}
             short- {2 Byte} or 16 bits
             int  - {4 byte} or 32 bits
             long - {8 byte} or 64 bits


             Note: How choose data type:
             i)	See the range in which the value fits
             a)	Only in the range of one data type  Use that data type
             b)	If it fits in range of multiple data types  Select the one which consumes the least memory


             byte b=10;
             b= b*20;
             system.out.println(b);

             Strings: Ashish, We are Learning Java

Day 14: Statements
         if statement
         if-else statement
         multiple if else if statement
         switch statement


==========================Syntax===========================

if(conditionToValidate)
{
   This code will execute only if condition is true
}

-----------------------------------------------------
if(conditionToValidate)
{
   This code will execute only if condition is true
}
else
{
   This code will execute only if condition is false
}

---------------------------------------------------
if(condition1)
{
   this code will execute
}
else if (condition 2)
{
   this code will execute
}
else if (condition 3)
{
   this code will execute
}
else if (condition 4)
{
   this code will execute
}
else if (condition N)
{
   this code will execute
}
else
{
   this code will execute if the condition fails
}

====> If a problem can be solved using both ifElseIf statement & switch Statement--> Give preference to
       switch statement

       in switch we cannot use >, < >=, <=
       switch cannot be used with long/float/double/boolean

       ----------------------------------------------
       Loops: We use loops to perform repetitive tasks
       Whenever we have group of something and we wish to perform some operation on that group

       while loop
       for loop
       advanced for loop
       for(dataTypeOfGroup aliasName:nameOfGroup)
       {
          action;
       }

       Syntax of while loop
       use a variable;
       while(define the condition over variable)
       {
          this code will execute till the time condition holds to be true
          I/D operator
       }

       syntax of for loop

       for(use a variable; define the condition over variable; I/D operator)
       {
          this code will execute till the time condition holds to be true
       }

       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Arrays: whenever we have to store group of values of similar data type
       Types of Arrays:
       static array
         1. dataType[] arrayName ={value1, value2, value3, value4.....valueN};
         2. dataType[] variableName = new dataType[countOfValuesYouWantToStore];

       dynamic array

         int x= {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
         the lowest index in an array will always be zero
         Highest index of an array is => size-1

         --------------------------------------------------------------------
         Define class: A class is a template or blue print of something
         Define Object: every copy of that class is called its object
         How to create object of class {how to create copy of a template programmatically}
         ==> NameOfTheClassWhoseCopyWeWantToCreate nameOfCopy = new NameOfTheClassWhoseCopyWeWantToCreate();
         Explain the relationship b/w class & Object: Class is a template and object is copy of that template
         Object w.r.t main(): We use main within our class whenever we wish to create
                              an object or a copy of an existing class

         Class & Object w.r.t heap & stack
         Null reference Object
         No Reference Object
         Garbage Collector
         Object Assignment to each Other


         int x=10;
         char y='c'
         boolean b=true;
         double f=12.34;


         Employee

         Employee emp1= new Employee();
         Employee emp2=new Employee();

         Abacus

         Abacus ab1= new Abacus();

         Car

         Car audi= new Car();


       Methods:
       The purpose why we are creating variables is called method
       A class consists of variables and methods
       Methods: Actions performed over class variables

       Syntax:

       accessModifier[public/private/protected] returnType[void/dataTypes] methodName(can/t parameters)
       {
           action over class variables
       }

       Global Variables or Class Level Variable or instance Variables=>variables within the class and outside the method
       Note: If you want your variable value to be shared by multiple methods of the same class, make it global/class level/instance variable


        Parameters:
        If you don't want your variable value to be shared by other methods of the class, pass it as parameter within the curved bracket of method


        Local Variables:
        If you always want your method should produce the same result for every object created, make it local variable, within the curved brackets of the method
        Whenever we create local variable its mandatory to assign value to it, as they can't be accessed anymore by object reference variables
