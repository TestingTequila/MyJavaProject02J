For override to happen
1. P-C relation should exist among classes[Through Inheritance]
2. Method to be overridden should exist in both P-C class

Method overloading happens within the same class BUT method overriding happens in different classes
that share P-C relationship(where inheritance exists)

A child can inherit parents property BUT a Parent cannot inherit a child Property

if a method is made final --> this cannot be overridden
if a class is made final  --> this cannot be inherited {This final class can never be Parent of any other class}
Variables cannot be overridden

Static method cannot be overridden--> because only what belongs to Object can be overridden and static is not part of object
