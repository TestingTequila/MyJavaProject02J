Encapsulation:
==> private variable + setter&getter methods
1. We made the variable private
2. set their values using setter method
3. get their values using getter method

==> private variable + constructors&getter methods
1. We made the variable private
2. set their values using constructors
3. get their values using getter method

==> private variable + constructors(setting)& getter methods + setter methods(to update the value set by Constructor)
   1. We made the variable private
   2. set their values using constructors
   3. get their values using getter method
   4. update the value of global variable using setter method
   5. again get the updated values

==> private methods encapsulated within public methods
