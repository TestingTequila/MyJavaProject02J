Any such property of a class whose 'VALUE' remains same across the objects of the class
we make such properties as static
Anything which is static, is not part of object, and since object is always stored in heap memory and
static is no longer part of Object, so this is stored in a separate memory called CMA/permanent generation/metaspace
We call static variables/methods using class name

Use Cases:
Calling non-static method within other non-static method
Calling static method within other static method
Calling non-static method within static method
Calling static method within non-static method

//Whenever we have to call a non-Static method, we can call only and only through object reference
//Whenever we have to call a static method, we can call only and only through Class Name;
