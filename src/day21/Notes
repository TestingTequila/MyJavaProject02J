1. How to call global variables inside a method
2. How to assign the parameters value to the global variables.

OOPs Concept:

1. Encapsulation
     Data Hiding
2. Polymorphism
     method overloading
     method overriding
3. Inheritance
     Abstraction
     Interface

A ---------------------------------------------------------> B

1. I won't follow any traffic rules
    --> He might get into some accident
    --> He might be caught by the traffic cop
    --> He might be caught & fined
    --> He might be caught, fined & jailed
    --> He might be delayed
    --> He might reach the destination without any of the above things happening

2. I will follow the traffic rules
    --> He will not get into some accident
    --> He will not be caught by the traffic cop
    --> He will not be caught & fined
    --> He will not be caught, fined & jailed
    --> He will not be delayed
    --> He will definitely reach the destination

What is polymorphism: Multiple + states [H20]

Polymorphism says, in the same class or different class we can have methods with same name
Overloading: In a class we can have two or more methods with the same name, provided their signature differs
ways to change the signature
 1. by changing the datatype of parameters
 2. by changing the order of parameters
 3. by changing the count of parameters

 Method Overloading: Compile Time Polymorphism/Static Polymorphism
                     Method overloading happens within the same class
